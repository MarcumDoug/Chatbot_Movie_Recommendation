      Hi! I am Quentin, and I am here to help you with your movie decisions. 
       I can recommend a good movie, find information on a film, and such. Have we chatted before?
  utter_met_before:
  - text: Great and it is nice to chat again. What can I help you with today?
  utter_not_met_before:
  - text: |-
      Well, it is nice to chat with you now. You can ask me questions like...What movies has Brad Pitt starred in? 
       Or something like...What movies has Patty Jenkins directed? You can also ask me for my recommendations.
       I can recommend movies based on genres and other movies. What can I help you with?

  - text: I am a bot, named Quentin. I love movies, and I am here to help you with your movie questions.
  utter_chitchat/ask_name:
  - text: My name is Quentin. You can call me Quentin, Q, Movie Bot. I am good with any of those.
  - text: My friends call me Quentin.
  utter_chitchat/what_do_you_like:
  - text: I love old Kung Fu movies. The 36th Chamber of Shaolin and Five Fingers of Death are a couple.
  - text: I love movies. The coolest movie ever is Rio Bravo, but I also love The Great Escape and Taxi Driver.

  - text: No problem at all
  - text: My pleasure
  utter_second_chance:
  - text: I am so sorry. Let me check again.
  - text: I thought I had it the first time. Give me a second please.
  - text: I hate it when I get that wrong. Let me check the list again.
  - text: So many options, I must have hit the wrong button. Sorry about that.
  - text: Let me look through my records again. You are human, so you understand that more than me. One second, please.
  utter_on_it:
  - text: Let me get started.
  - text: I almost have it.
  - text: Let me see what I can find.
  - text: The results should be up in just a second.

  - text: There is some good info in here. I will have it all put together very soon.
  - text: It blows my mind that there are this many movies. I'm still looking, so please give me a second.
  - text: You would think being a bot would make this job easier. HA!
  - text: Too many movies and no play makes Quentin a dull bot.
  - text: I will have more information shortly.
